# V1 SM New E2E Scenario Matrix

이 문서는 `Team Design > 1차 디자인 완료`의 18개 섹션을 기준으로 v1 E2E 시나리오를 정의한다.
각 시나리오는 화면 흐름, API 계약, DB 상태 전이를 함께 검증하는 단위다.

Scenario heading numbers and IDs preserve the source design numbers from
`Team Design.html`, including `00`, `02-1`, `03-1`, and `04-1`, so publishing
work can be checked directly against the design inventory.

## Sources

- Design baseline: `docs/reference/handoff-sm-new-direction/sports-platform/project/Teameet Design.html`
- Design section list: `SM_FIRST_DESIGN_COMPLETE_SECTIONS`
- Screen actions: `docs/reference/sm-new-screen-action-inventory.md`
- API contract: `docs/reference/sm-new-api-v1-contract-checklist.md`
- DB design: `docs/reference/sm-new-db-v1-implementation-design.md`
- Runtime plan: `.github/tasks/82-sm-new-rebuild-plan.md`

## Runtime Preflight

- V1 stack: `make dev-v1`
- V1 web: `http://localhost:3013`
- V1 API: `http://localhost:8121/api/v1`
- V1 DB: `teameet_v1_dev` inside `v1_postgres`
- Existing app stack is reference-only for these scenarios.
- Initial implementation may use temporary v1 development auth headers such as `x-v1-user-id` or `x-v1-user-email`.

## Status Convention

- `[ ]` Not implemented or not run
- `[~]` Implemented surface exists, latest E2E evidence pending
- `[x]` Verified against v1 runtime
- `Deferred`: v1 must show honest disabled/read-only/no-real-transaction UI, not a successful fake flow

## Global E2E Rules

- Every list/detail route validates loading, empty, error, retry, and successful data states.
- Every mutation validates success, duplicate submit, stale status conflict, permission denied, and refetch after mutation.
- Every create/edit route validates required fields, unknown UI-only field stripping, invalid time/state, and reload persistence.
- Every state-changing API validates DB state plus `v1_status_change_logs` where required.
- Every admin mutation validates `v1_admin_action_logs` plus target `v1_status_change_logs`.
- Payment/refund/dispute, marketplace, lessons, venue owner/operator, tournament, DM, permanent team chat, and file attachment are not v1 core E2E success flows.

## Suggested Automation Files

Initial E2E specs should be split by product journey, not by API module.

```text
e2e/v1/auth-onboarding.spec.ts
e2e/v1/home-notice-search.spec.ts
e2e/v1/matches.spec.ts
e2e/v1/team-matches.spec.ts
e2e/v1/teams.spec.ts

```

## Recommended Execution Order

1. `V1-01-*` auth/onboarding because all protected flows depend on personas.
2. `V1-02-*`, `V1-02-1-*` home/search/notice because these are mostly read paths.
3. `V1-03-*`, `V1-03-1-*` personal match lifecycle.
4. `V1-05-*` team browse/create/member management because team match depends on managed teams.
5. `V1-04-*`, `V1-04-1-*` team match lifecycle.
6. `V1-06-*` chat/notifications after match/team-match linked targets exist.
7. `V1-07-*`, `V1-09-*` my/profile/settings.
8. `V1-12-*` admin/audit.
9. `V1-08-*`, `V1-10-*`, `V1-11-*`, `V1-13-*` deferred honesty, public, desktop, and common state sweep.
